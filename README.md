# Advent of Code

Being my Python 3 ramblings and learnings in the world of festive problem solving. Over the last 10 years, the biggest achievement I've made is being able to actually complete a year (without too many hints) - in 2024, it was almost in the correct month :) so now I'm checking in everything I can track down in one place while I catch up and see if I can complete a full set of 450 stars before AoC ~~2023~~2025!
